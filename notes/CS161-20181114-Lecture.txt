Comand Line Arguments: passed as "./executable args"; int main (argc, argv) where argc is the number of elements in the array, and argv is an array of cstrings.
Defining a 2D Array on Heap: int ** array_2d; array_2d=new int*[3]; array_2d [0] = new int [2]; array_2d [1] = new int [2]; array_2d [2] = new int [2]; this creates an array of pointers, that point to multiple smaller "row" arrays.
