Defenitions: 
Structure: "struct", data structure containing multiple data types. Defined as struct <name> { //Variables defined per line// }; ; declared outside struct with <struct_name> <new_name>
End_Defenitions

Concepts
Using Structs: <struct_name> <new_name>; <new_name>.element = value; //repeat... 
Arrays and Structs: <struct_name> <array>[len]; for element of array, assign whatever struct elements are needed at that index of the array.
Pointers to Structs: <struct> <name1>; <struct>* <ptr_name> = &(name1); EITHER (*<ptr_name>).element=value OR <ptr_name>->element = value;
End_Concepts

Notes
Code to Make a 2D Array of Structs: Must be done dynamically, could also be done by passing triple pointer to fxn: struct_name ** create_Array (int rows, int cols){struct_name ** array_name = new struct_name * [rows];  for (int i=0; i<rows; ++i){array_name[i] = new struct_name[cols];} return array_name; }
Using a 2D Array of structs: struct_name ** pointer_name = create_Array(a,b); pointer_name[c][d].struct_value = value;
