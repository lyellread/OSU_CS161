Defenitions: 
Structure: "struct", data structure containing multiple data types. Defined as struct <name> { //Variables defined per line// }; ; declared outside struct with <struct_name> <new_name>
End_Defenitions

Concepts
Using Structs: <struct_name> <new_name>; <new_name>.element = value; //repeat... 
Arrays and Structs: <struct_name> <array>[len]; for element of array, assign whatever struct elements are needed at that index of the array.
Pointers to Structs: <struct> <name1>; <struct>* <ptr_name> = &(name1); EITHER (*<ptr_name>).element=value OR <ptr_name>->element = value;
