Chapter: 1

Defenitions
References: An alias to a variable. Declared as int a; int &reference = a; if a is changed, the reference changes as well. References are immutable. If you assign a value to a reference, it changes all the things (the original value and all references thereto).
Pointers: the memory address for where a particuliar variable is stored. To pass an address: fxn(&var1, &var2), where the function defenition would read "fxn(int * a, int * b). That function would receive the respective pointers for var(1|2).
End_Defenitions

Concepts
Syntax Things: calling a function with func(&a) if a is an int, will pass the memory address of a to func. 
With pointer a (defined as int * a;) you can get the value of what a points to with *a (dereference)

Notes
If you declare int &a, b; ONLY A WILL BE A REFERENCE
