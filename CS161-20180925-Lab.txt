Answers to the questions in the lab:

Question 1: What happens when you forget the semicolon at the end of the cout
statement? Be specific. (i.e.: std::cout << “Hello World!” << std::endl)

hello.cpp: In function ‘int main()’:
hello.cpp:6:2: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘return’
  return 0;
  ^

Compiling fails, as it expects a semicolon.

Question 2: What happens when you forget to include iostream, i.e. remove #include
<iostream> from the program? Be specific.

hello.cpp:5:2: error: ‘cout’ is not a member of ‘std’
  std::cout << "Heyo World!" << std::endl;
  ^
hello.cpp:5:32: error: ‘endl’ is not a member of ‘std’
  std::cout << "Heyo World!" << std::endl;
                                ^
Compiling fails as it was expecting the iostream library.

Question 3: What happens when you remove the << std::endl? What is the difference in
having it and not having it? (i.e.: std::cout << “Hello World!”;)

Removing the endline will remove the newline character after the output. This results in:

Heyo World!flip2 ~/labs/lab1 55$

instead of:

Heyo World!
flip2 ~/labs/lab1 47$

Question 4: What is the difference between the first and second program you wrote?

The first one just prints, while the second takes a user input and prints that value.

Question 5: What happens if you mix the direction of >> with the cin? Be specific. (i.e.: std::cin << number;)

Alot of errors print. This is because instead of trying to define the variable from the input, I would be trying to define the input from a blank variable (why on earth?).

Question 6: Why do you need to create a variable to display a number entered by the user?

Because you have to designate and allocate 'space' (a buffer somewhere) to contain the number.
