Defenitions
Default Arguments: When a function that takes arguments has those arguments defined in the header (i.e. int func(double var=1.223, double jack = 0.999)) NOTE: If you want arguments to be able to be passed by the call still, those variables must be first, and the default args must be last!!
Function Overloading: Making two functions that have the same name but different arguments. (either num or type)
